the hardware connections is only the onboard red LED which is connected to machine pin 6
i connected to my phone hotspot
in thing speak we use the on board temperature and hall sensor and send the data to server from our client where it is graphed over time
then we make a new server that we host were we display thecurrent data from the clients temperature and hall sensors and the current state of the led which we determine in the code. when the buttons are pressed we then update the onboard LED
